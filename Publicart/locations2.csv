Territorial Sundial,"During construction of the new State Library in the late 1950’s, it was decided that a sundial would be placed directly north of the main entrance to serve as a focal point for the viewing of the building. John W. Elliot, a Seattle master craftsman who had done prior relief work on a number of public buildings in the state, was selected to design and execute the Territorial Sundial.

Elliot’s magnificent hand-hammered, bas-relief sundial is made out of brass and measures six feet across (bas-relief is a specific type of relief where the protrusion of figures from the surface is very slight).",R,-122.9041449,47.03547728,WA,http://www.ga.wa.gov/visitor/sundial/sundial02.jpg,http://www.ga.wa.gov/visitor/sundial/sundial02.jpg

Tivoli Fountain,"The idea for adding this spectacular fountain to the capitol campus was first conceived by Peter G. Schmidt during his visit to Copenhagen, Denmark in 1949. It was at that time that Schmidt, then-president of the Olympia-Tumwater Foundation (a privately-funded organization created for the advance of recreational, benevolent, and educational projects for the State of Washington) was especially taken with a large fountain he saw there.
